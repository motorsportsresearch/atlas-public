# Atlas

Atlas is a free and open ECU calibration suite designed for performance tuning and reverse-engineering of modern vehicles. This project started as an effort to better understand the behavior of the 2022 WRX ECU but, as there is a lack of free and maintained tooling for software engineers and auto enthusiasts to gain first-party access to their ECUs, has since pivoted towards adopting a much broader feature set that encourages modern ECU research, recalibration and modification across increasingly diverse make and model lineups.

## Features
### Comprehensive Tuning Suite:
* Enables in-depth ECU research and to full recalibration capabilities through an automatic ROM analysis and table match function
* Supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X (including M-series), and Linux (including SteamOS and Raspbian), leveraging Java and open-source libraries
* Integrates the Ghidra SRE Framework bundle to analyze tables and emulate ROM machine code

### Versatile Connectivity:
* Supports the Tactrix OpenPort 2.0, OBDLink wireless and wired adapters as well as various ELM327 adapters via direct serial/COM connection with a natively-written driver in Atlas

### Advanced Visualization and Editing:
* Provides 2D and 3D OpenGL visualizations for gauges, tables, and function charts
* Offers a 1-2 dimension table editor with common arithmetic functions for efficient calibration editing
* Includes a live table definition interface to manage project tables and expedite table definition
* Features a value scaling configuration UI to rapidly create new scaling operations as they are identified within ECU logic

### Comprehensive Documentation and Diagnostics:
* Allows customization of memory parameters to notate ECU RAM offsets corresponding to specific metrics (e.g., RPM, Requested Torque, etc.)
* Provides a simple node graph to create and browse documentation of ECU behavior
* Includes gauges and a data logger for calibration diagnostics and troubleshooting, with project configuration and CSV export capabilities

### Streamlined Project Management:
* Offers a composite project system that consolidates all calibrations and ECU configurations in a single file
* Features an intelligent table-matching system to automatically detect new tables and discover existing tables in unknown variants
* Enables a consistent experience across model years and variants with an intelligent calibration cross-application function

## Emissions
North American Motorsports Research does not and will not condone, support, or facilitate the removal or bypass of any regulated emissions component of a target vehicle. This includes, but is not limited to, components, subsystems and design elements such as:

> - Emissions Related Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)
> - Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems
> - Tumble Generator Valves (TGVs)
> - Three-way Catalysts (TWCs)
> - Oxygen (O2) Sensors
> - Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) Sensors
> - Evaporative Emission System
