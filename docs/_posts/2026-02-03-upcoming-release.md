title: "2026 and Upcoming Features"
---

Hey, Atlas community! 2025 was a fantastic year for NAMR full of new innovations and platform refinement for the VA and VB WRX. We accomplished our goals by bringing a cutting-edge custom feature design system to our supported vehicles, expanded our definitions of supported ECUs in new & useful ways, and continued to push our community's VA and VB WRX projects further with more breakthroughs in FA motor ECU capabilities. While Atlas continues to drive a thriving community of DIYers and protuners forward with the accomlishments NAMR has already made, it's time for us to turn our attention towards the 2026 roadmap to continue to evolve the Atlas software product.

Our first release of 2026, aiming to elevate Atlas into an even more powerful product, **2026.1**, is coming soon. We are in the final stages of testing the absolutely enormous amount of work that our team and beta testers have invested into the product and community. To accompany this release, new 3rd party off the shelf (OTS) revisions and community-designed custom features are slated to be available at that time as well.

Starting with our next release, we are excited to bring forward new accomplishments from an expanded vision for Atlas. We collaborated with professionals across the industry to uncover new ECU tables/parameters, integrated Atlas with powerful & affordable hardware products, and refined the Atlas ecosystem to unlock your vehicle's maximum potential. We can't wait to unveil the full details on release as soon as final testing is complete!

To our Patrons and donators and on behalf of all of NAMR, an enormous **thank-you** is in order - you help us keep the lights on and fund our R&D for this beloved project. And to our community and beta testers, thank you for your continued support and advocacy of the platform!

Stay tuned for Atlas 2026.1!
