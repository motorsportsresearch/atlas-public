title: "Open Beta!"

Atlas has completed it's closed beta period, and although this took a bit longer than we had hoped, we're now ready for our first beta release!

We are excited to announce that the Atlas tuning platform is now entering an open beta testing phase! After months of rigorous development and a successful limited beta, we are ready to open up the platform to a wider audience of enthusiasts.

The open beta is available to all owners of a 2022 or 2023 Subaru WRX equipped with either a WRX (TY75) or STI (TY85) 6-speed manual transmission. In addition, participants must have a supported OpenPort adapter and be comfortable with tasks such as ECU flashing, engine modification, calibration tweaks, and adjusting engine sensor calibrations, fueling, airflow and other associated tables and values.

This open beta period will allow us to gather valuable feedback and insights from a larger pool of users to further refine and improve the Atlas platform before its general release.

To participate in the open beta, please visit our [download page]({{ '[/download.html' | absolute_url }}). We look forward to working with the community to make Atlas the best tuning solution for Subaru enthusiasts.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress towards the general release of Atlas!
